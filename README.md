# Flex Meal Tracker

## Overview
This app is used as a digital meal tracker. It was designed specifically for tracking progress in alignment with the Flex Meal Plan (as part of a weightloss program offered through Red Mountain Weightloss*). This solution was created because participants in the program do not have a digital method of documenting meals and weightloss and are only provided with journal materials.

**This app is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Red Mountain Weightloss*

## Features
The Flex Meal Tracker app not only tracks meal details (including protein, fat, fruit, and vegetable quantities per meal), but also allows users to track their water intake, exercise achievements, weight and measurements each day.

Additional application features:

* Ensure private/protected information using login and registration (with field and database validation and protected routes)
* Click nav bar items to highlight or navigate user to appropriate pages
* Manage account information, including starting weight and measurements when beginning the program
* View snapshots of overall weight lost, inches lost, and exercise statistics
* Get a list of exercises for certain muscle groups (using the API Ninjas Exercises endpoint) as inspiration to continue reaching exercise goals
* Live calendar to select day for logging meals
* Full CRUD functionality for daily log entries
* 
* "Back to top" feature for each page
* Click the GitHub and Linkedin icons in the footer to view more information about the app and creator
* Features the use of CSS3 pseudo classes

## To Do List:

MUST HAVE:
- Clear session when cancelling form submissions (consider making a cancel/blah route for each cancel button to clear session and redirect appropriately)

- Finalize readme


NICE TO HAVE:
- Add light/dark mode toggle to Account page

- Upon sign-up, redirect to Account Page with banner/alert to setup initial weight/measurements (only present to user if this data doesn't exist in the db yet)

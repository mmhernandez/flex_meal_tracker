# flex_meal_tracker


To Do List:

- Get the hydrate buttons to remain active for each "glass" of water consumed

- Upon sign-up, redirect to Account Page with banner/alert to setup initial weight/measurements (only present to user if this data doesn't exist in the db yet)

- Graphs in python to display in a dashboard/stats page
    (show weight over time and display target/goal weight)
    (show how many inches lost over time)

- Create "About" page that can be located from the "Home" tab (maybe also chaange that to say "About" instead)

- Add sex to Account page.
- Use M/F sex selection in the account to present info on the dashboard (maybe use an API to pull in helpful articles or motivational stuff)

- Look at the AJAX chapter (https://login.codingdojo.com/m/506/12469/87490) for info on how to sign-up and log-in w/o page refresh

- Turn "?" help text into alert/pop up with password requirements (might look better HTML formatted)

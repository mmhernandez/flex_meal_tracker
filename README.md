# flex_meal_tracker


To Do List:
- Get the hydrate buttons to remain active for each "glass" of water consumed
- Change "weigh-in" to a "Weight & Measurements" section that pops a modal form with the daily weight and measurement details
    (bust, midsection, abdomen, hips, right-arm, left-arm, right-thigh, left-thigh)

New stuff to research:
- Save prompt before leaving the page (so users don't lose edits if they forget to save)
- Graphs in python to display in a dashboard/stats page
    (show weight over time and display target/goal weight)
    (show how many inches lost over time)
